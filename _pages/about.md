I'm an Assistant Professor of Statistical Science at Duke University, with a secondary appointment in Mathematics. I was a postdoc in Biostatistics at Harvard University from 2023 to 2025 and obtained a PhD in Mathematics from Duke in 2022.

I develop statistical and machine learning methods for uncovering structure and mechanisms in complex data, with emphasis on variable selection, graph estimation, and nonparametric inference. I'm especially interested in applications to medicine and public health.
