I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University, with a secondary appointment in the Department of Mathematics. I was previously a postdoc in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University, and received my PhD in Mathematics from Duke University.

My research focuses on statistical and machine learning methods for uncovering structure and mechanisms in complex, high-dimensional data, with emphasis on variable selection, graph estimation, and nonparametric inference. I am especially interested in applications to medicine and public health.
