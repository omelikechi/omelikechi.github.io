I'm an Assistant Professor of Statistical Science at Duke University, with a secondary appointment in Mathematics. Previously, I was a postdoc in Biostatistics at Harvard University and received my PhD in Mathematics from Duke.

My research focuses on statistical and machine learning methods for uncovering structure and mechanisms in complex, high-dimensional data, with emphasis on variable selection, graph estimation, and nonparametric inference. I am especially interested in applications to medicine and public health.
